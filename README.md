# Gain registration metric with a minimal example
An implementation of the paper [Fundus Image Transformation Revisited: Towards Determining More Accurate Registrations](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8417242/) by Danilo Motta, Wallace Casaca and Afonso Paiva.

In this paper we presented a metric to define the best transformation for register a given image pair of fundus images.

This code is a simplistic example of the process developed.

## Files
* max_gain_transf.m: contains the process that finds the best transformation
* max_gain_transf.m: run this for an quick example
