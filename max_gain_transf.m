function [T,gain,ttype] = max_gain_transf(P1,P2,BW1,BW2)
%MAX_GAIN_TRANSF Finds the transformation that maximizes the Gain metric
%          The algorithm takes two sets of corresponding points
%          and the binary images as input and outputs the best transformation that
%          registered the binaries

% Input -  P1: an array with size N X 2 containing the first set of points.
%       -  P2: N X 2 vactor containing the corresponding points of the first set of points
%       -  BW1: binary image from where P1 were taken
%       -  BW2: binary image from where P2 were taken

% Output - T: the best transformation found
%        - gain: the best gain obtained
%        - ttype: the best transformation type
